0.609   2020-01-28  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- complete_comma_sep: Don't use ununiquify_answer to prevent space being
	  added; instead, use the is_partial property as it is more proper. We
	  need Complete::Bash 0.334 to properly render this though.

	- Mark the ununiquify_answer function as hidden, as it is now
	  unused.


0.608   2020-01-13  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Add functions: answer_has_entries, answer_num_entries.


0.607   2019-12-23  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- [bugfix] combine_answer() didn't handle case where each word is a
	  hash.


0.605   2019-12-15  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- [doc] Remove Complete::Tree from mention (now becomes
	  Complete::Sequence, but just like Complete::Path this is not
	  directly related to Complete::Util anyway).


0.604   2019-12-15  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: low

	- No functional changes.

	- [doc] Mention Complete::Tree.

	  complete_hash_key().


0.600   2017-12-08  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [ux] Do prefix char-mode matching before char-mode matching, this
	  can give more discriminating matches before trying out full
	  (unanchored) char-mode matching.


0.59    2017-07-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add function: ununiquify_answer.

	  customization of what to offer for the next element.


0.55    2016-10-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR

0.54    2016-10-22  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [dist][bugfix] Text::Levenshtein::XS accidentally added as
	  RuntimeRequires prereq.


0.53    2016-10-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - No need to fallback to another XS (Text::Levenshtein::XS)
          implementation, just try Text::Levenshtein::Flexible then fallback to
          our PP implementation.


0.52    2016-10-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [doc] Add FAQ item about speeding up fuzzy matching.

	- [Bugfix] Remember levenshtein implementation properly.


0.51    2016-10-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Use Text::Levenshtein::Flexible first (because it can give a
	  speed boost by specifying maximum distance), then fallback to
	  Text::Levenshtein::XS, then to our PP implementation.

	- Add complete_comma_sep().


0.46    2016-04-05  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Bugfix] complete_array_elem(): When there is replace_map, @arrayn was
	  longer than the original array because we appended to it replace_map
	  entries. We now use a copy of original array (@array) to make @array
	  and @arrayn of the same length again.

	- Add logging statement (enabled only when COMPLETE_UTIL_TRACE=1).


0.45    2016-01-05  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Update to Complete::Common 0.22 (OPT_CHAR_MODE).

        - complete_array_elem(): Implement char-mode matching (done when normal
          prefix matching and word-mode matching fails to return any results,
          before fuzzy matching).

          OPT_MAP_CASE.


0.42    2015-12-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [experimental][ux] In word mode completion, try matching word
	  like 'ca-c' with strings like 'CamelCaseWord' by internally
	  converting the string into 'Camel-Case-Word' first, this is
	  convenient when matching e.g. perl module names.


0.41    2015-11-29  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Adjust to Complete::Common 0.21.

	- [Removed] For more consistent user experience, remove options

	- Tweak word-mode matching: allow searching non-first word using

	- [Removed] Split complete_file, complete_env, complete_program to
	  their own dists, for better modularity and avoid circular
	  dependencies.


0.35    2015-09-12  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add fuzzy matching to complete_array_elem().


0.34    2015-09-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	  DevelopRecommends to reduce deps but still allow indicating spec
	  requirement.

	  of startup time.


0.31    2015-06-08  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Previous guess about $^O not being properly localized was
	  incorrect, the test failures on Windows were caused by path
	  containing /:/ (thanks kmx).


0.30    2015-06-07  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Skip test when we cannot set $^O temporarily  Released-By: just my guess
	  [RT#104981].

        - Add options to complete_file(): starting_path, handle_tilde,
          allow_dot. These options can be used to limit/restrict file searching,
          so it cannot go outside a certain path.


0.24    2015-03-04  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Follow Complete 0.12 (escmode renamed to esc_mode).

          (but not ~foo [yet?] which requires completing username instead of
          files).


0.13    2014-07-13  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - complete_file(): Replace 'file' and 'dir' options with the more
          generic 'filter'.


0.12    2014-07-02  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - This release is a re-organization of Complete::Util into Complete::*
          modules family.

        [REMOVED FEATURES]

        - Move bash specific functions to Complete::Bash. This includes:
          mimic_shell_dir_completion(), format_shell_completion(),
          break_cmdline_into_words(). Complete::Util now only contains generic
          complete_*() functions.

        - Move developer notes to Complete.

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - complete_array() is renamed to complete_array_elem() (but old name is
          still provided, with no documentation mentioning it, for current
          module users; the old name will be removed someday in the future).

        - complete_file() no longer does mimic_shell_dir_completion(). You'll
          have to do it yourself (but, format_completion() from Complete::Bash
          will do it for you).


0.11    2014-06-29  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Add optional param 'sep' in mimic_shell_completion(), used in
          format_shell_completion().


0.10    2014-06-29  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [INCOMPATIBLE]

        - Change interface of mimic_shell_dir_completion() and
          break_cmdline_into_words() to accept positional arguments. This makes
          it more consistent: all complete_* accept hash/named args, while the
          rest positional.

        - Apply mimic_shell_dir_completion() logic in format_shell_completion()
          when given hint is_path=>1.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add intro docs to make it clearer how to use this module.


0.09    2014-06-27  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Fix format_shell_completion().


0.08    2014-06-27  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Change interface of format_shell_completion() (accept positional args
          to make it shorter).


0.07    2014-06-26  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No longer uses bash to break cmdline into words. This solves some
          issues like $var no longer being substituted by bash (allowing env
          completion to work), unclosed quotes work, etc.

        - Add developer's notes.

        - Add format_shell_completion().


0.06    2014-06-26  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - complete_program(): add 'ci' option, handle Windows where PATH is
          split by /;/ and not /:/.

0.03    2014-05-05  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes.

        - [test] Skip case sensitive test on Windows [CT].


0.02    2013-11-04  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Rename parse_{bash,shell}_cmdline().


0.01    2013-11-03  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - First release. Split from Perinci-BashComplete because the routines
          are general and not tied to Perinci/Rinci.
